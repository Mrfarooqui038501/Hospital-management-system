# Healthcare Services API

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000/api/services`.

## Usage

### API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

| Method | Endpoint                | Description                         |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/services`         | Get a list of all healthcare services |
| POST   | `/api/services`         | Create a new healthcare service    |
| PUT    | `/api/services/:id`     | Update an existing healthcare service |
| DELETE | `/api/services/:id`     | Delete a healthcare service        |

### Authentication

The API endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting services require authentication. To authenticate, include the following header in your requests:

### Pagination

The `GET /api/services` endpoint supports pagination. You can use the following query parameters:

- `page` (default: 1): The page number to retrieve.
- `limit` (default: 10): The number of results to return per page.

### Search and Filtering

The `GET /api/services` endpoint also supports searching and filtering. You can use the following query parameters:

- `search`: Search for services by name or description.
- `category`: Filter services by category (e.g., `OPD`, `DENTAL`, `CARDIOLOGY`, `DERMATOLOGY`, `PEDIATRICS`, `OTHER`).
- `sort`: Sort the results by a specific field (e.g., `name`, `price`, `createdAt`).

## Development

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

## Project Structure
  The project structure is organized as follows:

  - `config/`: Holds configuration files for the database and logging.
  - `controllers/`: Defines the logic for handling API endpoints.
  - `middleware/`: Contains custom middleware functions, such as error handling and authentication.
  - `models/`: Defines the Mongoose schemas and models.
  - `routes/`: Defines the API routes and maps them to the corresponding controllers.
  - `scripts/`: Contains utility scripts, such as the database seeding script.
  - `utils/`: Holds utility functions and custom error classes.
  - `validators/`: Contains the input validation logic.
  - `server.js`: The main entry point of the application.
- `logs/`: Stores the log files generated by the application.
- `tests/`: Contains the test files for the application.
- `.env`: The environment variables file.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies the files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `package.json`: Defines the project dependencies and scripts.

## Technologies Used
